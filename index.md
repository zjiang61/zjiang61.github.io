<!---
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working in [Professor Schleife group](http://schleife.matse.illinois.edu). My current research focuses on using first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory, to study electronic, magnetic and phonon properties of materials. I study magnon damping in hybrid magnonic systems. I am also exploring novel topological properties in condensed matter systems, for electrons as well as other elementary excitations such as phonons, plasmons and magnons. 
Before the postdoc training at UIUC, I obtained my Physics PhD in December 2021 from the University of Southern California (USC), under the supervision of Professor Stephan Haas in the group of [Computational Condensed Matter Theory](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cmt/). The main research topic during my PhD was plasmonic excitations in low-dimensional quantum materials. Two particular directions were investigated: surface plasmons in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators, and 2D plasmons in layered metals tuned by inhomogeneous external screening environment. I used a self-programmed code based on the random phase approximation method in the real space, which can calculate dynamical dielectric response functions for clusters of any shape. In 2014, I obtained my BS in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) under the supervision of Professor Zengming Zhang. <!---The thesis work was Upconversion Luminescence of NaYF<sub>4</sub>:Yb,Er Nanomaterials Doping Metal Ions (Li<sup>+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>).-->

  
**Bio**  
My name is Zhihao Jiang, PhD in Physics. My research interest is exploring novel properties of electrons as well as elementary excitations (phonons, magnons, plasmons, etc.) in condensed matter systems, maily focusing on phenomena related to correlation and topology. I use both theoretical (band theory, Green's functions, many-body perturbation theory) methods and computational techniques (empirical tight-binding model, first-principles simulations).
